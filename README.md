# gradle-kotlin-dsl-spring-boot-sample
I thought that "Gradle Kotlin DSL" + "Kotlin Spring Boot" samples were a bit outdated.
 So I have uploaded mine, if anyone has any interest.

This application should work out-of-the-box with latest gradle versions, and should be a
 perfectly good spring boot app, with a home page.

Perfect for anyone who wants a full kotlin-language spring project and doesn't want to
 mess with gradle.
